        "question_text": "Search neutrality.  Search neutrality  Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias.    Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet.  Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.   Section::::Background.   The term \"search neutrality\" in context of the internet appears as early as March 2009 in an academic paper by Andrew Odlyzko titled, \"Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets\".",
