# TREC iKAT annotation interface for response evaluation

## Description 
This is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the evaluation of responses generated by conversational AI systems. The application provides a user-friendly interface where authenticated users can view various conversations and rate them based on specific metrics. 

## System Architecture

### Backend

The backend of the system is built using the Flask micro web framework. It handles server-side logic, including:

- **User Authentication**: The backend manages user sessions, allowing users to log in, sign up, and log out.
- **Data Management**: The backend interacts with an SQLite database to fetch, store, and manage user evaluations of conversations.
- **Routing**: Flask routes determine what should happen when a user visits a particular URL. For instance, the `/login` route handles user login, while the `/evaluate` route processes user evaluations.
- **Template Rendering**: Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine to serve dynamic HTML templates. This allows the backend to generate web pages based on data from the database.

### Frontend

The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for evaluating conversations. Its built using:

- **HTML**: The structure of the web pages is defined using HTML. The provided code contains a main content area where conversations are displayed and a side pane that shows the evaluation rubric.
  
- **CSS**: The visual styling of the web pages is defined using CSS. The provided code uses Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to ensure a responsive and modern design. Custom styles are also defined to enhance the user interface.
  
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the web pages. The provided code uses jQuery, a popular JavaScript library, to handle user interactions like submitting evaluations. AJAX calls are made to the backend to send and retrieve data without reloading the page.
  
- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap components and scripts are used to enhance the user interface and provide a responsive design. This ensures that the web application looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Installation with Conda
### Prerequisites 
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/)

### Steps 
Follow the steps below to run the code.

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/shubham526/ikat-annotation-interface.git
cd ikat-annotation-interface
```
2. Create a new Conda environment and activate it:
```
conda create --name $env_name python=3.9
conda activate $env_name
```
where `$env_name` is the name of the Conda environment you wish to use. 
3. Install Flask:
```
conda install flask
```
4. Create the database:
```
python create_db.py
```
> **Note.** The script will attempt to read the data from a file called `data.json` in the same directory as this script. It will create a database called `ikat-database.db`, also in the same directory as this script. The app will expect the database to be present at this location.
5. Run the application:
```
python app.py
```
## Usage
- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
- If you're a new user, sign up. Otherwise, log in.
- Browse through the conversations and submit your evaluations.

## Downloading the evaluation results
We provide a script to fetch evaluation results from an SQLite database and organize it by user. The organized data is then written to a JSON file. 

### Command-line arguments
The script accepts two command-line arguments:
- `--database`: The path to the SQLite database file.
- `--save`: The path (including filename) where the organized data should be saved as a JSON file.
- 
### Run the script
```
python create_db.py --database $PATH_TO_DATABASE --save $PATH_TO_SAVE_JSON
```

### Example JSON created by the script:
```

        {
                "user_id": "user1",
                "evaluations": [

                    },
