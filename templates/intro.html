            <h2 class="opaque-text">Welcome to the Response Evaluation system for TREC iKAT 2023</h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for participating in this evaluation. You'll be shown a series of conversations where the
                USER poses questions about a specific topic, and the SYSTEM provides corresponding answers.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will not be shown full conversations. Instead, you will be presented with the initial user
                utterance followed by the conversation context, which includes the last three user-system dialogues leading up to the response you'll
                evaluate. An ellipsis between the first utterance and the context indicates there are additional
                dialogues not displayed. Use the initial utterance to understand the user's primary information need
                and combine this understanding with the given context to make your judgments. The response you're
                evaluating will be highlighted within a grey box for easy reference.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Task:</strong> You must evaluate the last SYSTEM response of
                each dialogue in terms of its <b>relevance</b> and <b>completeness</b> in relation to the
                entire conversation. Your judgements should be on a scale of 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest). If you cannot make a
                judgement, you can choose -1 (see rubric).
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, you must write a short explanation of why you
                have given this judgement. This must be different from the text in the rubric. The explanation must explain
                <i>why</i> you feel this judgement is correct. See the examples on the right for what a good explanation
                should look like. The examples can also be found

            </p>
            <p>
                Please read each conversation carefully and provide your evaluation using the provided dropdown menus.
            </p>

                            be vaguely related, but too divergent from the conversation.
                            <li><strong>2 Relevant:</strong> Follows on, but it is not entirely clear why the response is being presented.

                    <h4>Relevance:</h4>

                    <p><strong>0 Not Relevant:</strong><br>
                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "Bananas are rich in potassium and make a healthy snack."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> The response doesn't address the question about the heart at all and instead discusses a completely unrelated topic about bananas.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>1 Partially Relevant:</strong><br>
                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "The heart is an important organ. Many people also use the word 'heart' to describe emotions and feelings."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> While the response mentions the heart, it diverges into emotional connotations of the word "heart" which isn't directly relevant to the user's query about its functions.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>2 Relevant:</strong><br>
                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "The heart pumps blood, but blood also carries oxygen."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> The system addresses the heart and its function to pump blood but does not provide a complete or clear answer to the user's question.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>3 Highly Relevant:</strong><br>
                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "The heart's main function is to pump blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues and removing waste products."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> The response directly and comprehensively addresses the user's query, covering the main functions of the heart.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Completeness Section -->

                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "The heart is in the chest."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> The response does not address the user's question about the heart's functions, providing only a basic fact about its location.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>1 Somewhat:</strong><br>
                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "The heart pumps blood."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> The response addresses part of the user's question by mentioning the heart's role in pumping blood, but it doesn't elaborate or cover other functions.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>2 Yes (but not completely):</strong><br>
                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "The heart pumps blood and ensures oxygen is delivered to tissues."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> The answer addresses the main functions of the heart but might not capture all the nuances or details.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>3 Yes:</strong><br>
                    User: "Can you tell me about the main functions of the heart?"<br>
                    System: "The heart's main function is to pump blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues and removing waste products."<br>
                    <em>Clarification:</em> The system's response comprehensively covers the heart's main functions, directly and fully addressing the user's query.
