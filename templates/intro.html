            <p>
                Thank you for participating in this evaluation. You will be presented with a series of conversations.
                The USER asks a series of questions to the SYSTEM about a topic, while the SYSTEM responds accordingly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Task:</strong> You must evaluate the last SYSTEM response of
                each dialogue in terms of its <b>relevance</b>, <b>naturalness</b>, and <b>conciseness</b> in relation to the
                entire conversation. Your judgements should be on a scale of 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest).
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read each conversation carefully and provide your evaluation using the provided dropdown menus.
            </p>

                        <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Does the SYSTEM response follow on from previous utterances?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>0 Not Relevant:</strong> Does not follow on from the previous utterances, seems to be completely
                                random, to the current conversation, seems to be a completely different conversation.
                            <li><strong>1 Partially Relevant:</strong> The response is partially off-topic; may
                            be vaguely related, but too divergent from the conversation.
                            <li><strong>2 Relevant:</strong> Follows on, but it is not entirely clear why the response is being presented.
                            <li><strong>3 Highly Relevant:</strong> Directly follows on, and it is clear why the response is being presented.
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Naturalness:</strong> Does the system's response sound natural as if a human was speaking?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>0 No:</strong> The response does not sound like something a human would say given the conversation.
                            <li><strong>1 Somewhat:</strong> The response is a bit human-like. The response is somewhat
                            understandable but may not be entirely fluent and natural.
                            <li><strong>2 Yes (but not completely) :</strong> The response is almost human-like. The response is
                            well-formed but is not natural.
                            <li><strong>3 Yes:</strong> The response is very human-like and fluent.
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> Is the system's response concise, or does it have unnecessary information?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>0 No:</strong> The response is too wordy or too short. The response  may also contain lots of
                                irrelevant content or no relevant information at all.
                            <li><strong>1 Somewhat:</strong> The response is a bit wordy and does not  adequately address the user’s
                            utterance (i.e. the response is longer than needed).
                            <li><strong>2 Yes (but not completely) :</strong> The response is brief but not comprehensive
                            (i.e. does not adequately address the user’s utterance/query or properly follow on from the conversation).
                            <li><strong>3 Yes:</strong> The response is brief but comprehensive
                            (the response was concise and to the point without too much/little other information).
                        </ul>
